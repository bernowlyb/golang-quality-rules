- **Severity:** Critical  
- **Tags:** Brain Overload, Clean Code  
- **Attribute:** Adaptability | Focused  
- **Software Qualities Impacted:** Maintainability  

## Why is this an Issue?

Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard the control flow of a function is to understand. Functions with high Cognitive Complexity will be difficult to maintain and should be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.

## Parameters

- **threshold** - The maximum authorized complexity.  
  - **Default Value:** 15

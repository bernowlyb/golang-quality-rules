# "switch" statements should not have too many "case" clauses

## Rule Details

- **Rule ID:** go:S1479

- **Effort:** 30 minutes  
- **Type:** Code Smell

- **Tags:** Brain Overload, Clean Code  
- **Attribute:** Adaptability | Focused  
- **Software Qualities Impacted:** Maintainability  

## Why is this an Issue?

When `switch` statements have a large number of `case` clauses, it is often an attempt to map two sets of data. A real map structure would be more readable and maintainable, and should be used instead.

## Parameters

- **maximum** - Maximum number of branches in a `switch` statement.  
  - **Default Value:** 30

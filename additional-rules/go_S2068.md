# Hard-Coded Credentials Are Security-Sensitive

## Rule Details

- **Rule ID:** go:S2068  
- **Analysis Scope:** Main sources  
- **Rule Repository:** Sonar (Go)  
- **Effort:** 30 minutes  
- **Type:** Security Hotspot  
- **Severity:** Blocker  
- **Tags:** CWE  
- **Software Qualities Impacted:** Security  

## What is the Risk?

Because it is easy to extract strings from an application source code or binary, **credentials should not be hard-coded**. This is particularly true for applications that are distributed or open-source. Hard-coded credentials pose a significant security risk and have led to real-world vulnerabilities, such as:

- **CVE-2019-13466**
- **CVE-2018-15389**

## How Can I Fix It?

Instead of hard-coding credentials, store them **outside of the code** in a:

- Configuration file
- Database
- Secret management service

This rule flags instances of hard-coded credentials used in **database and LDAP connections**. It detects credentials in **connection strings** and **variable names** that match any of the configured patterns.

### Recommended Customization

It is advisable to customize the configuration of this rule by adding additional credential-related words, such as:

- `oauthToken`
- `secret`

## Parameters

- **credentialWords** - Comma-separated list of words identifying potential credentials.  
  - **Default Value:** `password,passwd,pwd,passphrase`

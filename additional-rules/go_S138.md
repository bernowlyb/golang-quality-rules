# Functions and Methods Should Not Have Too Many Lines

## Rule Details

- **Rule ID:** go:S138  
- **Analysis Scope:** Main sources  
- **Rule Repository:** Sonar (Go)  
- **Effort:** 20 minutes  
- **Type:** Code Smell  
- **Severity:** Major  
- **Tags:** Brain Overload, Clean Code  
- **Attribute:** Adaptability | Focused  
- **Software Qualities Impacted:** Maintainability  

## Why is this an Issue?

A function that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities. Such functions inevitably become harder to understand and, therefore, harder to maintain. When a function exceeds a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor it into smaller functions that focus on well-defined tasks. These smaller functions will not only be easier to understand but also easier to test.

## Parameters

- **max** - Maximum authorized lines of code in a function.  
  - **Default Value:** 120

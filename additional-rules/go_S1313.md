# Using Hardcoded IP Addresses is Security-Sensitive

## Rule Details

- **Rule ID:** go:S1313  
- **Analysis Scope:** Main sources  
- **Rule Repository:** Sonar (Go)  
- **Effort:** 30 minutes  
- **Type:** Security Hotspot  
- **Severity:** Minor  
- **Tags:** None  
- **Software Qualities Impacted:** Security  

## What is the Risk?

Hardcoding **IP addresses** is **security-sensitive**. It has previously led to vulnerabilities such as:

- **CVE-2006-5901**
- **CVE-2005-3725**

Today’s **scalable and redundant architectures** constantly change. Assuming that a service will always have the same IP address is **incorrect**. When the IP changes, the hardcoded value will have to be modified, impacting **development, deployment, and security**:

- **Developers** will need to fix it manually instead of allowing **operations teams** to update a configuration file.
- **Environments (dev, sys, qa, prod)** might unintentionally use the same IP.
- **Security risks:** Attackers can decompile the code, exposing a sensitive IP. This can lead to:
  - **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks** on the service.
  - **Unauthorized system access attempts**.
  - **IP spoofing** to bypass security controls.

Such attacks can always occur, but resolving a **hardcoded IP issue** takes longer, increasing an attack’s potential impact.

## How Can I Fix It?

- Use **configuration files** or **environment variables** to store IP addresses dynamically.
- Implement **DNS names** instead of static IP addresses.
- Use **service discovery mechanisms** if applicable.

## Exceptions

No issue is reported for the following cases, as they are **not considered security-sensitive**:

- **Loopback addresses:** `127.0.0.0/8` (from `127.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`)
- **Broadcast address:** `255.255.255.255`
- **Non-routable address:** `0.0.0.0`
- **Object Identifiers (OID):** Strings of the form `2.5.<number>.<number>`
- **Reserved documentation addresses (RFC 5737 & RFC 3849):**
  - `192.0.2.0/24`
  - `198.51.100.0/24`
  - `203.0.113.0/24`
  - `2001:db8::/32`
